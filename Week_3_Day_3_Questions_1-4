# Week 3 Day 3 Homework (Questions 1-4)

#1 Write a program that creates a list of 20 numbers input by the user
# and prints the average (mean) of the list.

numbers = []
for i in range(20):
  numbers.append(eval(input("Enter a number: ")))
print(sum(numbers)/len(numbers))

#2 Write a function "mangle" that takes a string as a parameter
# and returns the string after performing the following operations:
# i. Converting the string to all upper case letters
# ii. Removing the third character
#  iii. Removing the third to last character

def mangle(str):
  str = str.upper()
  str = str[0:2] + str[3:-3] + str[-2:]
  return str
 
def main():
  print(mangle("hellothere"))

main()

#3 Write a function, count_e, that takes a list of strings as a parameter and
# returns the total number of upper and lower case e’s (“E” and “e”) in all the
# strings in the list. Test that your function works with multiple examples.

def count_e(list):
  num_e = 0
  for string in list:
    num_e += string.upper().count("E")
  return num_e
 
def main():
  print(count_e(["hi", "hello", "EEK!"]))

main()

#4 Write a function, count_vowels, that takes a list of strings as a parameter
# and returns the total number of upper and lower case vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in all
# the strings in the list.

def count_vowels(list):
  num_vowels = 0
  for string in list:
    upper = string.upper()
    for vowel in "AEIOU":
      num_vowels += upper.count(vowel)
  return num_vowels
 
def main():
  print(count_vowels(["hi", "hello", "OOF!"]))

main()
